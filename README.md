# Extended Essay

## Introduction

This is a program I developed in High School to perform an experiment for my Extended Essay of the IB curriculum.

My topic was "To what extent can the time complexity of graph search algorithms be used to predict its runtime while it solves the single-source shortest path problem?" This program helps answering this question by running the Bellman-Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm (each with a different time complexity) on randomly-generated graphs of different number of verticies.

## Guide

If you so choose to run this program, it is a simple command-line Java program with the usual main function. The number of random graphs to generate, number of attempts for each graph, and the number of verticies to use are all hard-coded values within the main function which the user can change at will.

Once the program executes, it may take a very long time to finish all the runs (depending on how you set the parameters), and the results will be placed in the `output/` folder in your home's Downloads folder.
